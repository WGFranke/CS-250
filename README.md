CS 250 Module Eight Journal Guidelines

Interpreting the users needs is uncovering why they want a feature before implementing it. User stories are the key to uncovering why the user wants that feature in the first place. They are high-level information contaning details of what a developer needs to code that feature. The user story follows the template of "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that   [a value]". This statement filled in with the users answers help uncover why they want a feature. 

When approching development of programs I do not look at the whole project as one big thing, instead I break it down into smaller more managable chunks. In my future work in developing in Agile I will always keep these things in mind to help myself succeed. Working in sprints to create a foundation of stability and rythm in my work. Being brief and inforamtive in my daily 15-minute stand up meeting. At the end of every sprint taking meaningful time to reflect on the sprint and what could I improve on. 

Being a good team member in software development is more than just knowing how to code. It is about people skills and knowing when to step up for the team and when to let someone else take the lead. Being a reliable team member and stick to deadlines that are set will help build trust with my co-workers. Being very detail oriented so when others look at my work it is easy to read. Hepling others when they are stuck will help them learn and help me grow as a leader.
